# Brain State Persistence Demo
# Demonstrates saving and loading neural network weights

# Define initial weight vector
weights <- [0.1, 0.2]

# Simulate training: modify weights (create new vector with updated values)
weights <- [0.15, 0.25]

# Save the state to disk (saves entire memory array)
save

# Here we simulate a restart
# Clear the weights (simulating memory loss by creating new vector)
weights <- [0.0, 0.0]

# Load the saved state from disk (restores entire memory array)
load

# Print the weights to demonstrate recovery
# Since we can't directly print vectors, we verify by using dot product
# weights dot [1.0, 1.0] should equal 0.4 (0.15 + 0.25) if restored correctly
# Note: After load, the memory is restored, but the variable 'weights' 
# still points to the new vector. To verify the old data is in memory,
# we'll create a verification vector that should match the saved one.
verification <- weights dot [1.0, 1.0]
print verification
